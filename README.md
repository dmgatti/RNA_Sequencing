# RNA Sequencing Data Analysis for Beginners

his course was designed for students who have a background in molecular
biology and are interested in learning how to analyze RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq)
data. RNA-Seq is an analytical method which measures the amount of 
RNA that has been transcribed from each gene. It involves some sophisticated
molecular biology, expensive instruments, and generates large volumes of data
which are beyond what standard office software and laptops can handle. This 
means that you will need to use both specialized software and remote high-
performance computing systems. In order to work with these systems, you will
need to learn some basic programming skills. This course is designed to help
you learn these skills and to apply them to RNA-Seq analysis.
