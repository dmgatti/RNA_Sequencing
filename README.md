# RNA Sequencing Data Analysis for Beginners

This course was designed for students who have a background in molecular
biology and are interested in learning how to analyze RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq)
data. RNA-Seq is an analytical method which measures the amount of 
RNA that has been transcribed from each gene. It involves some sophisticated
molecular biology, expensive instruments, and generates large volumes of data
which are beyond what standard office software and laptops can handle. This 
means that you will need to use both specialized software and remote high-
performance computing systems. In order to work with these systems, you will
need to learn some basic programming skills. This course is designed to help
you learn these skills and to apply them to RNA-Seq analysis.

## Target Audience 

This course is designed for students who have some background in molecular
biology and no background in programming. 

## Prerequisites

You should have some background in molecular biology. Specifically, you 
should be able to:
* define what DNA is and understand its role in the cell,
* define what RNA is and understand its role in the cell,
* understand the cellular process of transcribing DNA into RNA and 
translating RNA into protiens.

## Learning Objectives

After complering this course you should be able to:

1. Understand what RNA-sequencing is and what kind of data it produces.
1. Write short scripts in the bash programming language which use variables
and loops.
1. Assess the quality of an RNA-Seq experiment using FastQC and
MultiQC.
1. Decide whether to trim the reads and know how to do this using fastp.
1. Align reads to a reference genome using STAR and quantify gene counts
using RSEM.
1. Read in, analyize, and plot data using the R programming language.
1. Identify differentially expressed genes between experimental groups from
an RNA-Seq experiment.
1. Identify differentially expressed biological pathways between experimental 
groups from an RNA-Seq experiment.
